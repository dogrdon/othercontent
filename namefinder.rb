Ideally this script, no matter what type of bot you want to create, it should
take in a text corpus of words that describe the type of stuff the bot will do

require 'optparse'

# take in a text file or a list of possible keywords

# do some magic to create some possible options

# check them against twitter

# spit out a list of possibilities
